## Installation 🛠️

If you are cloning the project then run this first, otherwise you can download the source code on the release page and skip this step.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/matheusmorita/nft_minting_dapp.git
```

Make sure you have node.js installed so you can use npm, then run:

```sh
npm install
```

After all you can run.

```sh
npm run start
```

Or create the build if you are ready to deploy.

```sh
npm run build
```

Now you can host the contents of the build folder on a server.

That's it! you're done.
